            <p>I am an experienced Application Support Engineer with a demonstrated track record of success in the
                computerÂ software industry. I am skilled in API testing, Using Automation Test Frameworks, Root Cause
                Analysis,
                Advanced Platform Integrations, and Customer Relationship Management. I help lead the Atlanta
                Application Support Team at
                Tricentis.</p>
            <p>I have extensive experience in the SaaS space, and I am committed to life-long learning and continuing my
                education. I plan to grow my skills beyond my current role into something more technical.</p>
            <p>When I am not at work, I enjoy a number of hobbies. I read sci-fi and fantasy novels (Sanderson - Way of
                Kings currently); I play video games with my friends (PS4 - Call of Duty and Rocket League); I play with
                my dog Leo
                (German Shepherd); I have attended Dragon Con for the last ten years, as it is just before my birthday;
                I enjoy traveling, and I have been to seven countries in the last year (Vietnam, Korea, Mexico, Canada,
                UK, Austria, and Hungary). </p>
